On Monday, March 13th, the group working on “Modeling Domestic Space” presented the first results from the project.

Is it possible to model domestic space in fiction? And what might such a model show about the features of domestic space, its discursive correlates, its historical and generic distribution, and more broadly about space and domesticity? Focusing on British nineteenth-century novels, this project attempts to make such a model. Along the way, we discuss why this seems like a tractable kind of space to model; why nineteenth-century novels present an important case; and how exactly we might operationalize domestic space and conceptualize a model of it.
