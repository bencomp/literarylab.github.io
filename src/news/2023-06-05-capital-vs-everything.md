We finished the year with the first presentation of our Mellon-funded investigation into Literary Theory and Criticism.

The *Theory and Criticism* project explores the relationship between literary theory and literary criticism in the 20thÂ Century. The project is in the early stages of assembling corpora of literary theoretical and critical monographs, and is excited to share its progress so far, and some preliminary results provisionally titled "*Capital* and Everything Else."
